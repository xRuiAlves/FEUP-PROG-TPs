# PROG

This repository is used for me to getting familiar with GitHub and to post some programs and "usefull" bits of code developed in the Curricular Unit "Programação" from the Integrated Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at FEUP.

In this Curricular Unit the programming language used is C++, allthough there are some mentions to C, such as C libraries and some specific syntax.
