# PROG

This repository is used for me to getting familiar with GitHub and to post some programs and "usefull" bits of code developed in the Curricular Unit "Programação" from the Integrated Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at FEUP.

In this Curricular Unit the programming language used is C++, allthough there are some mentions to C, such as C libraries and some specific syntax.


EDIT: The "Solved Exercises" folder isn't very organized - The repository was created at a time that I didn't understand how to correctly use Git, which made this whole repository somewhat messy.
